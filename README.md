# My First Docker Image...

Run this command, to build the docker image, make sure docker is installed!!

```bash
./dockerbuild.sh
```

Run this command, to start a docker container, that's it ...easy!!
```bash
./dockerstart.sh
```

Note: On Average it can take 600 seconds to build the image! If you ever get any error, run the build command (./dockerbuild.sh) again,
the cached resources will be used and you will get the docker container runnning!
